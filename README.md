# learn-python-with-me

A beginner-friendly mini-project to help absolute newcomers feel confident with Python’s core data types
This repository is my very first Python learning journey – created as I’m teaching myself (and hopefully helping others) understand the basics step by step.

What’s inside
learn_python_with_me.ipynb – A clean, fully-commented Jupyter notebook that gently introduces:
Integers & basic math
Floats (decimal numbers)
Lists
Tuples
Sets (unique collections)
Dictionaries (key-value pairs)

Simple examples, plain-English explanations, and little exercises with solutions

Perfect for you if…

You’ve never written a line of Python before
You get confused about when to use a list vs. a tuple vs. a set
You want short, bite-sized lessons you can finish in one sitting
